My name is Christopher Doer and I am a research associate and PhD candidate at the Institute of Control Systems (IRS), Karlsruhe Institute of
 Technology (KIT) supervised by Prof. Gert F. Trommer. 
 Before that, I obtained my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at KIT.
 During my studies I gained further experience doing several internships and research assistant jobs in Germany and
  the  USA.
I am interested in autonomous aerial vehicles (e.g. drones or VTOLs) enabling applications such as urban air mobility, parcel delivery, search and rescue, surveillance and maintenance.

# Research
My main research focus is the robust and reliable navigation of aerial vehicles even in challenging visual conditions such as darkness or fog and in GNSS degraded or GNSS denied environments.
I am working on multi domain approaches with FMCW radar, thermal imaging and inertial sensing. I demonstrated these approaches for takeoff and precision landing and online navigation of autonomous drones successfully even in degraded visual conditions successfully.

My name is Christopher Doer and I am a research associate and PhD candidate at the Institute of Control Systems (IRS), Karlsruhe Institute of
 Technology (KIT) supervised by Prof. Gert F. Trommer. 
 Before that, I obtained my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at KIT.
 During my studies I gained further experience doing several internships and research assistant jobs in Germany and
  the  USA.
I am interested in autonomous aerial vehicles (e.g. drones or VTOLs) enabling applications such as urban air mobility, parcel delivery, search and rescue, surveillance and maintenance.



# Research

My main research focus is the robust and reliable navigation of drones even in challenging conditions such as darkness or fog and without relying on GNSS for outdoor and indoor flight scenarios.
I am working on multi domain approaches with FMCW radar, thermal imaging and inertial sensing. I demonstrated these
 approaches for takeoff and precision landing and for online navigation of drones successfully.
